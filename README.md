[[Graph Abstract](https://github.com/leke-lyu/transmissionCount/blob/main/figures/overview.pdf)]

Included components:
- **Subsamplerr R package** for proportional sampling
- Scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization
- Guidelines on how to adjust parameters for customized analyses

## Data

The data used in this study is partially available in this repository, with some components accessible upon request due to [any applicable restrictions]. For reproducibility, ensure the data is in the expected format as outlined in `data/README.md`.

To get started:
1. Place all required data files in the `data` directory.
2. Follow the file naming conventions and format requirements for seamless integration with the scripts.

## Analysis and Visualization

The `analysis` folder includes scripts for conducting the following:
- **Data Analysis**: Scripts for calculating core metrics, including Source Sink Score and Local Import Score.
- **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Steps for tree generation and related calculations.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluate metric stability across different regions or datasets.
- **Visualization**: Generate publication-ready figures reflecting the studyâ€™s findings.

Each script includes specific instructions and is designed to be modular, allowing users to adjust for various data types or research questions.
